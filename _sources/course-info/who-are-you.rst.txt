- You have been programming 3 years (median)

    - Some of you have just started whereas some of you have programmed over 15 years

- Many of you have experience either in Python (86 %) or R (71 %).

    - You have experience also from many other languages such as Java, C, Javascript, Matlab, Pascal, PHP, Bash

- Most of you understand the basics of programming well. Good!

GIS background

- Most of you have experience in Quantum GIS (86 %) and ArcGIS (86 %)

    - You have also experience from many other GIS softwares / frameworks such as MapInfo, R, GRASS, PostGIS, Geoserver, GDAL, MapServer, MapProxy, Deegree, Sqlite/Geopackage, OpenLayers, Cesium, PDAL

What would you like to learn?
-----------------------------

**What will be covered**

- Introduction to Python libraries for GIS
    - **Good!** That is exactly what we are here for! ðŸ˜Ž

- Raster processing in Python

   - The basics of raster processing in Python will be introduced but not any remote sensing stuff

- How to use CSC computing resources?

   - There is a short introduction included to the topic

**What cannot be covered**

- Using ArcGIS + QGIS with Python

   - Won't be covered (would require separate courses) but there are some materials available:
        - `Introduction how to use QGIS with Python <https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2017/lessons/L6/01-overview.html>`__.
        - `Introduction how to use ArcGIS (arcpy) with Python <https://automating-gis-processes.github.io/2016/Lesson6-overview.html>`__.

- How to use Python in web service backends?

    - This is out of the scope of this course but I would recommend checking e.g. `Flask (web framework) <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`__ with `GeoAlchemy2 <https://geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ or `Psycopg2 <http://initd.org/psycopg/>`__ for communicating between PostgreSQL / PostGIS database and the application, or as an alternative you can check `Geodjango <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/gis/>`__ geographic Web framework based on `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__.
