    "The most fundamental geometric objects are `Points`, `Lines` and `Polygons` which are the basic ingredients when working with spatial data in vector format. Python has a specific module called [Shapely](http://toblerity.org/shapely/manual.html) that can be used to create and work with `Geometric Objects`. There are many useful functionalities that you can do with Shapely such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Create a `Line` or `Polygon` from a `Collection` of `Point` -geometries\n",
    "-  Calculate areas/length/bounds etc. of input geometries\n",
    "-  Conduct geometric operations based on the input geometries such as `Union`, `Difference`, `Distance` etc.\n",
    "-  Conduct spatial queries between geometries such `Intersects`, `Touches`, `Crosses`, `Within` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Objects consist of coordinate tuples where:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-  `Point` -object represents a single point in space. Points can be either two-dimensional (x, y) or three dimensional (x, y, z).\n",
    "-  `LineString` -object (i.e. a line) represents a sequence of points joined together to form a line. Hence, a line consist of a list of at least two coordinate tuples\n",
    "-  `Polygon` -object represents a filled area that consists of a list of at least three coordinate tuples that forms the outerior ring and a (possible) list of hole polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is also possible to have a collection of geometric objects (e.g. Polygons with multiple parts):**\n",
    "\n",
    "-  `MultiPoint` -object represents a collection of points and consists of a list of coordinate-tuples\n",
    "-  `MultiLineString` -object represents a collection of lines and consists of a list of line-like sequences\n",

Collections of points are implemented by using a MultiPoint -object, collections of curves by using a MultiLineString -object, and collections of surfaces by a MultiPolygon -object. These collections are not computationally significant, but are useful for modeling certain kinds of features. A Y-shaped line feature\n",
