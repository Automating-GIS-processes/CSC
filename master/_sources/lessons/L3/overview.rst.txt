Overview
========

During this lesson we will learn a few really useful and commonly used GIS functionalities using Geopandas, namely:

1. :doc:`Geocoding addresses to Points (and vice versa) <geocoding>`
2. :doc:`Retrieve OpenStreetMap data <retrieve-osm-data>`
3. :doc:`Data classifications <reclassify>`

Learning goals
--------------

After this lesson you should be able to:

 - Do geocoding, i.e. converting addresses into Points (and vice versa)
 - Download data from OpenStreetMap using Python
 - Reclassify data based on different criteria (custom or common classifiers).
