Download datasets
=================

Before we start you need to download (and then extract) the dataset zip-package used during this lesson `from this link <https://github.com/Automating-GIS-processes/Lesson-5-Making-Maps/raw/master/data/dataE5.zip>`_.

You should have following Shapefiles in the ``dataE5`` folder:

  - addresses.shp
  - metro.shp
  - roads.shp
  - some.geojson
  - TravelTimes_to_5975375_RailwayStation.shp
  - Vaestotietoruudukko_2015.shp

Extract the files into a folder called ``data``:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd
    $ unzip dataE5.zip -d data
